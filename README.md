# SnakeGameOOP
Simple console based snake game created in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Run the 'snake.exe' file to play. use 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to move up, left, down, and right respectively ('q' to quit).

(you cannot die, collect fruit and watch the snake grow!)

If you are seeing an error when trying to run the snake.exe (such as libstdc++-6.dll), this means you must install the MinGW-w64 toolchain.
